# GIP-0002: Setting the Initial Governance Token Parameters

## Summary
Define the initial parameters for the governance token of the GPUFuel ecosystem, ensuring alignment with community and platform goals.

---

## Motivation
The governance token is central to GPUFuel's decentralized decision-making process. Properly defining its initial parameters will ensure:
- Equitable distribution
- Active community participation
- Platform sustainability

---

## Specification
### Token Name and Symbol
- **Name:** GPUFuel Governance Token
- **Symbol:** GFT

### Total Supply
- **Total Supply:** 5,000,000 GFT

### Initial Distribution
| **Category**             | **Percentage** | **Allocation**       |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Founders and Team        | 30%            | 150,000,000 GFT      |
| Company Reserve          | 25%            | 125,000,000 GFT      |
| Staking Rewards          | 15%            | 75,000,000 GFT       |
| Compute Redemption       | 25%            | 125,000,000 GFT      |
| Marketing and Community  | 5%             | 25,000,000 GFT       |

### Governance Rights
- **Voting Power:** 1 GFT = 1 Vote
- **Proposal Submission Threshold:** 1,000 GFT

### Token Minting and Burning
- **Minting Cap:** None (fixed supply)
- **Burn Mechanism:** Unused tokens from transaction fees may be burned to reduce supply over time.

---

## Rationale
The distribution ensures both initial platform stability and long-term decentralization by reserving tokens for community engagement and ecosystem growth. 

- **Comparison:** Fixed vs. Inflationary Supply
  - A fixed supply creates predictable governance dynamics.

---

## Implementation Plan
- **Milestone 1:** Smart contract development and auditing (2 months).
- **Milestone 2:** Initial distribution via community campaigns (3 months).
- **Milestone 3:** Token launch on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

---

## Backward Compatibility
Not applicable. This is a new governance token.

---

## Test Cases
1. **Distribution Validation:** Verify token allocation matches the specified percentages.
2. **Voting System Tests:** Ensure 1 GFT = 1 vote functionality.
3. **Burn Mechanism Tests:** Confirm tokens are correctly removed from supply when burned.

---

## Security Considerations
- **Smart Contract Risks:** Comprehensive audits will be conducted.
- **Governance Exploits:** Proposal thresholds prevent malicious actors from overwhelming the system.
