# Decentralized compute network in the Cloud

## Summary
This GPUFuel Improvement Proposal (GIP) introduces a decentralized GPU resource-sharing network where GPU owners ("Node Operators") monetize idle computational resources, and users ("Job Submitters") access GPU power using GPUFuel tokens, built on Solana.

## Motivation
Expand GPUFuel’s utility beyond the centralized platform by leveraging a decentralized network for GPU resource sharing, reducing costs for users, providing income for GPU owners, and increasing GPUFuel token adoption.

## The Idea
Users can connect their idle GPUs to our network, and in term get rewarded with GPUFUel. The users pay for their workloads through GPUFuel as well. The result is a decentralized compute system that enables both small-grade and enterprise-grade actors in the market to use their underutilized-compute.

## Specification

### Goals
- Establish a decentralized GPU node network.
- Use GPUFuel tokens on Solana for payments.
- Implement smart contracts for job creation, matching, and validation.
- Build a GPU resource marketplace with dynamic pricing.

### Components

#### Node Operators
- Stake GPUFuel tokens to join.
- Provide GPU resources to earn tokens.
- Maintain uptime and quality to avoid penalties.

#### Job Submitters
- Stake GPUFuel tokens to submit jobs.
- Specify requirements (GPU type, VRAM, deadline).
- Pay upon successful job completion.

#### Smart Contracts
- **Job Matching**: Match jobs to nodes based on specifications.
- **Escrow Payments**: Lock tokens until validation.
- **Proof-of-Execution**: Verify completed jobs.

#### Proof-of-Execution
- Watermarked intermediate outputs.
- Validator nodes confirm output quality.
- Failed validation penalizes nodes.

#### Marketplace
- **Job Bidding**: Nodes bid to accept jobs.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on demand and GPU availability.
- **Premium Services**: Prioritize urgent jobs.

#### Storage
- Use IPFS/Filecoin for job inputs/outputs.

### Technical Architecture

#### Blockchain Layer
- **Solana**: High speed and low fees for transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Manage job creation, escrow, and validation.

#### Orchestration Layer
- Decentralized software for node registration and job management.
- Scheduler to match jobs with nodes.

#### Storage Layer
- Temporary local storage on nodes.
- Permanent storage on IPFS/Filecoin.

### Tokenomics
- **GPUFuel Token**: Payment and staking currency.
- **Node Staking**: Incentivize quality and uptime.
- **Job Escrow**: Secure payments for submitters.

## Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Solana smart contracts for job matching and escrow.
2. Develop node operator software for workload execution.
3. Build the job marketplace interface.
4. Launch a PoC with limited nodes and users.
5. Scale to fully decentralized orchestration.

## Benefits
- Reduced GPU costs.
- Income for GPU owners.
- Increased token utility and adoption.

## Drawbacks
- Token volatility.
- Requires robust validation mechanisms.


## Conclusion
This GIP proposes expanding GPUFuel’s ecosystem with a decentralized GPU resource-sharing network on Solana, creating a transparent, scalable, and fair system for GPU resource allocation and utilization.
