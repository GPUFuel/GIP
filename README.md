# **GPUFuel Improvement Proposals (GIPs)**

**GPUFuel Improvement Proposals (GIPs)** are the formal mechanism for proposing, discussing, and implementing changes, features, or processes within the GPUFuel ecosystem. They allow the community to collaborate transparently and contribute to the evolution of GPUFuel.

---

## **Purpose**
The GIP process is designed to:

- Provide a structured framework for proposing changes or improvements.
- Facilitate discussion and feedback from the GPUFuel community.
- Promote transparency and collaboration in GPUFuel‚Äôs development.
- Ensure GPUFuel's governance remains community-driven and inclusive.

---

## **Types of GIPs**
1. **Core GIPs**: Changes to GPUFuel's architecture, governance, or tokenomics.
2. **Feature GIPs**: Proposals for new features, enhancements, or optimizations.
3. **Informational GIPs**: Documentation or guidelines for the community, clarifications, or FAQs.
4. **Process GIPs**: Proposals for changes in workflows, tooling, or governance processes.

---

## **GIP Workflow**
The GIP process follows a structured workflow:

1. **Idea Stage**:
   - Start a discussion in the [Discussions](https://github.com/GPUFuel/GIPs/discussions) section.
   - Clearly explain the problem or idea and gather community feedback.

2. **Draft Stage**:
   - Create a draft GIP using the [template](./GIP-template.md).
   - Submit it as a Pull Request (PR) to the repository under the `proposals/` directory.
   - Collaborate with maintainers and the community to refine the draft.

3. **Review Stage**:
   - Once the draft is complete, it is reviewed by GPUFuel maintainers.
   - Feedback is provided, and revisions are made until the proposal is finalized.

4. **Final Comment Period (FCP)**:
   - Approved proposals enter an FCP for additional community input (usually 7 days).
   - Any final changes are made based on feedback.

5. **Voting (if required)**:
   - Proposals requiring governance approval go to a vote on [GPUFuelVote](#link-to-voting-platform).
   - Proposals meeting the required thresholds are approved.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Once approved, the GIP is implemented and marked as `Deployed` after successful integration.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository organizes proposals for clarity and accessibility:

- `GIPs/`: Final, approved proposals (e.g., `GIPs/GIP-0001.md`).
- `proposals/`: Draft proposals under discussion or review.
- `archive/`: Rejected, closed, or obsolete proposals.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation for the GIP process and governance.

---

## **Creating a GIP**
All GIPs must adhere to the [GIP Template](./GIP-template.md). The key sections include:

- **Abstract**: A summary of the proposal.
- **Motivation**: Why this change is necessary and what problem it solves.
- **Specification**: Detailed technical or procedural implementation.
- **Rationale**: The reasoning behind design decisions and alternatives considered.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Any potential impact on existing systems.
- **Implementation**: A high-level plan or requirements for deployment.

## **Governance**
GIPs serve as a community-driven governance tool. GPUFuel welcomes contributions from all stakeholders, including developers, token holders, and other participants. Governance decisions are made through discussions, consensus, and voting when necessary.

For governance-related discussions, join our [Discord community](#link-to-discord) or the [Discussions section](https://github.com/GPUFuel/GIPs/discussions).

---

## **Voting Mechanism**

- Proposals requiring community approval are voted on via [GPUFuelVote](#link-to-voting-platform).
- Voting thresholds and quorum requirements vary based on the proposal type.

---

## **Contributing**
