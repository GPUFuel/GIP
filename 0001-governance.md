# GIP-0001: Governance Framework for GPUFuel Improvement Proposals (GIP)

## Summary
This document establishes the governance framework and processes for managing GPUFuel Improvement Proposals (GIPs). The goal is to ensure transparent, efficient, and community-driven decision-making for the GPUFuel ecosystem.

## Motivation
As GPUFuel grows, we require a clear and structured approach to propose, discuss, and implement changes or improvements to the ecosystem. GIPs provide a standardized method for documenting and reviewing proposals, fostering collaboration, and ensuring alignment with the community's goals.

## Specification

### GIP Workflow

1. **Proposal Drafting**
    - Authors draft a new GIP using the [GIP Template](GIP-TEMPLATE.md).
    - Each GIP is assigned a unique identifier and adheres to the filename format: `GIP-XXXX-title.md`.

2. **Community Feedback**
    - Proposals are submitted as pull requests to the GIP repository.
    - Discussions occur in the repositoryâ€™s Discussion section or on the GPUFuel community channels.

3. **Review Process**
    - Designated reviewers evaluate the proposal based on feasibility, clarity, and alignment with GPUFuel's mission.
    - Revisions may be requested before proceeding to the next stage.

4. **Voting and Approval**
    - Approved proposals are voted on by stakeholders using the GPUFuel governance token.
    - The threshold for approval is defined in the governance smart contract.

5. **Implementation and Deployment**
    - Approved GIPs proceed to implementation, testing, and deployment.
    - Progress updates are shared with the community.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Authors**: Draft and submit GIPs.
- **Reviewers**: Assess and provide feedback on GIPs.
- **Community Members**: Participate in discussions and votes.

## Status Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial submission for community feedback.
2. **In Review**: Undergoing evaluation by reviewers.
3. **Voting Open**: Ready for voting.
4. **Approved**: GIP has passed voting and is scheduled for implementation.
5. **Rejected**: GIP did not pass the voting process or was withdrawn.
6. **Implemented**: GIP has been successfully deployed.

## Rationale

A structured governance framework ensures that all stakeholders have a voice in GPUFuel's development. By defining clear roles, workflows, and lifecycle stages, we can maintain transparency and accountability while fostering innovation.
